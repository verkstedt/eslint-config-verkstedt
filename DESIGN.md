# Design Goals

- **All–purpose**
  - Installation should be easy and straightforward
  - Ideally projects would not have to customise _anything_ and not
    install any extra plugins.

- **Follow recommended configurations**
  - For stylistic rules that might be a matter of taste, follow
    default or recommended settings, unless there’s an overwhelming
    majority of users preferring a different option.

- **Additional rules that help to avoid common pitfalls**
